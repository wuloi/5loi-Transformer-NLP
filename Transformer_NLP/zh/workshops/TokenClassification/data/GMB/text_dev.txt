Malta produces only about 20 % of its food needs , has limited fresh water supplies , and has few domestic energy sources .
Malta 's geographic position between the EU and Africa makes it a target for illegal immigration , which has strained Malta 's political and economic resources .
Malta adopted the euro on 1 January 2008 .
Malta 's financial services industry has grown in recent years and in 2008 - 09 it escaped significant damage from the international financial crisis , largely because the sector is centered on the indigenous real estate market and is not highly leveraged .
Locally , the restricted damage from the financial crisis has been attributed to the stability of the Maltese banking system and to its prudent risk-management practices .
The global economic downturn and high electricity and water prices hurt Malta 's real economy , which is dependent on foreign trade , manufacturing - especially electronics and pharmaceuticals - and tourism , but growth bounced back as the global economy recovered in 2010 .
Following a 1.2 % contraction in 2009 , GDP grew 2 % in 2010 .
In early 2011 , the EU ended excessive deficit procedures against Malta , after Malta had taken measures to correct an excessive deficit in 2010 and appeared likely to reach its deficit target of 2.8 % of GDP in 2011 .

Another 27 percent described their feelings as " somewhat favorable , " and 23 percent of those surveyed reacted negatively to the president 's remarks .
The network says its polling organization interviewed 464 people .
Because the survey involved only people who watched the speech on television , CNN says the comments include more favorable opinions than a true random sampling might indicate .
According to CNN , the poll had a five-percent margin of possible error .
Forty~three percent of those who took part said they were Republicans , 23 percent said they were Democrats and 34 percent described themselves as independents .

A Spanish judge has reinstated an international arrest warrant for three U.S. soldiers on charges arising from the death of a Spanish journalist in Iraq .
Judge Santiago Pedraz filed the warrant Tuesday in a case arising from the 2003 shelling of a hotel in Baghdad in which Spanish television journalist Jose Couso was killed .

With the Farmer came his Lapdog , who danced about and licked his hand and frisked about as happy as could be .
The Farmer felt in his pocket , gave the Lapdog some dainty food , and sat down while he gave his orders to his servants .
The Lapdog jumped into his master 's lap , and lay there blinking while the Farmer stroked his ears .

In 788 , about a century after the Arab conquest of North Africa , successive Moorish dynasties began to rule in Morocco .
In the 16th century , the Sa'adi monarchy , particularly under Ahmad AL-MANSUR ( 1578 - 1603 ) , repelled foreign invaders and inaugurated a golden age .
The Alaouite dynasty , to which the current Moroccan royal family belongs , established a sultanate in Morocco beginning in the 17th century .
In 1860 , Spain occupied northern Morocco and ushered in a half century of trade rivalry among European powers that saw Morocco 's sovereignty steadily erode ; in 1912 , the French imposed a protectorate over the country .
A protracted independence struggle with France ended successfully in 1956 .
The internationalized city of Tangier and most Spanish possessions were turned over to the new country that same year .
Sultan MOHAMMED V , the current monarch 's grandfather , organized the new state as a constitutional monarchy and in 1957 assumed the title of king .
Morocco annexed Western Sahara during the late 1970s , but final resolution on the status of the territory remains unresolved .
Gradual political reforms in the 1990s resulted in the establishment of a bicameral legislature , which first met in 1997 .
Under King MOHAMMED VI - who in 1999 succeeded his father to the throne - human rights have improved .
Morocco enjoys a moderately free press , but the government occasionally takes action against journalists who report on three broad subjects considered to be taboo : the monarchy , Islam , and the status of Western Sahara .
Despite the continuing reforms , ultimate authority remains in the hands of the monarch .
Influenced by protests elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa , thousands of Moroccans in February and March 2011 rallied in Rabat and several other major cities to demand constitutional reform and more democracy and to protest government corruption and high food prices .
Police response to most of the protests was subdued compared to the violence elsewhere in the region .
In early March , King MOHAMMED VI agreed to establish a commission to reform the country 's constitution ; a popular referendum held in early July 2011 overwhelmingly approved the new constitution .
The Sudanese Republic and Senegal became independent of France in 1960 as the Mali Federation .
When Senegal withdrew after only a few months , what formerly made up the Sudanese Republic was renamed Mali .
Rule by dictatorship was brought to a close in 1991 by a military coup - led by the current president Amadou TOURE - enabling Mali 's emergence as one of the strongest democracies on the continent .
President Alpha KONARE won Mali 's first democratic presidential election in 1992 and was reelected in 1997 .
In keeping with Mali 's two-term constitutional limit , KONARE stepped down in 2002 and was succeeded by Amadou TOURE , who was subsequently elected to a second term in 2007 .
The elections were widely judged to be free and fair .
Britain 's attorney-general says seven British soldiers will stand trial for allegedly murdering a civilian in southern Iraq in 2003 .
Attorney-General Peter Goldsmith says Thursday the incident occurred on a road in al-U'Zayra in May , 2003 .

They gave no other details , or mentioned a date for the proceedings .
Britain currently has about 9,000 troops deployed in southern Iraq .
Since the U.S.-led invasion almost two years ago , British officials have launched more than 130 investigations into incidents ranging from road traffic accidents to deaths of Iraqis in custody .

A new audiotape attributed to Osama bin Laden is calling on Muslims to launch a jihad , or holy war , to stop Israel 's offensive in the Gaza Strip .
The tape was posted Wednesday on Islamist Web sites where al-Qaida usually issues its messages .
The authenticity of the tape could not be immediately verified .
A White House spokesman , Gordon Johndroe , said the tape appears to show bin Laden 's isolation and his efforts to stay relevant " at a time when al-Qaida 's ideology , mission and agenda are being questioned and challenged throughout the world . "
The spokesman said the tape also looks like a bid to raise money in what he called al-Qaida 's ongoing propaganda campaign .
Palestinians have clashed with Egyptian police at the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip .
Witnesses and police say angry Palestinians threw stones at border guards after only a limited number of them were allowed to enter Egypt .
At least six police were injured .
Police used water cannons against the crowd .
Egypt opened the crossing on Tuesday to allow entry by Palestinians who need medical treatment not available in Gaza .
Egypt has kept the Rafah crossing closed since the militant group Hamas seized control of Gaza more than a year ago .
In January , Hamas militants blew open the border wall , allowing thousands of Palestinians to stream into Egypt to buy goods that are scarce in Gaza , which is subject to an Israeli blockade .
Egypt sealed the border breach about two weeks later .

Egypt 's upper house of parliament Sunday approved a decree from President Hosni Mubarak for a two-year extension to the term of local councils , most of which are dominated by members of the ruling National Democratic Party .
Its passage through the lower house this week is almost certain .
The banned Muslim Brotherhood says the move is an effort to block its allies from capturing more local council seats , after gains in recent parliamentary elections .
The United States has imposed sanctions on Iran 's maritime carrier and its affiliates for allegedly supporting Iran 's nuclear and missile programs .
The designation against the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines and 18 affiliates means their assets under U.S. jurisdiction will be frozen .
Americans also are prohibited from doing business with the carrier and affiliates .

Gabon enjoys a per capita income four times that of most sub-Saharan African nations , but because of high income inequality , a large proportion of the population remains poor .
Gabon depended on timber and manganese until oil was discovered offshore in the early 1970s .
The oil sector now accounts for more than 50 % of GDP although the industry is in decline as fields pass their peak production .
Gabon continues to face fluctuating prices for its oil , timber , and manganese exports and the global recession led to a GDP contraction of 1.4 % in 2009 .

The rebound of oil prices from 1999 to 2008 helped growth , but drops in production have hampered Gabon from fully realizing potential gains .

Mexican President Vicente Fox is continuing his tour of the western United States that coincides with a debate in the U.S. Senate on immigration reform .
Mr. Fox is addressing a special meeting of the Utah state legislature Wednesday .
He then travels on to Washington state , where he is to speak with Mexican laborers .
On Tuesday , at the start of his four-day trip , Mr. Fox told an audience in Utah that building a fence along the U.S.-Mexico border is not the answer to the immigration problem .

Developing countries say a U.N. climate change report being drafted in Thailand should acknowledge that poor nations contribute little to global warming , but suffer its worst effects .
Delegates from poor nations attending the climate change conference in Bangkok this week also are demanding that rich countries share their cleaner energy-producing technologies .
A Sri Lankan delegate says some developing countries are forced to burn fossil fuels because they can not afford to develop more environmentally friendly methods of generating power .
Scientists and experts from about 120 countries are negotiating the contents of the U.N. climate change report , which is expected to be released at the end of the conference on Friday .
The report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is expected to call for the world to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by investing in renewable energy and reforestation .

Severe volcanic activity , which began in July 1995 , has put a damper on this small , open economy .
A catastrophic eruption in June 1997 closed the airports and seaports , causing further economic and social dislocation .
Two-thirds of the 12,000 inhabitants fled the island .
Some began to return in 1998 but lack of housing limited the number .
The agriculture sector continued to be affected by the lack of suitable land for farming and the destruction of crops .
Prospects for the economy depend largely on developments in relation to the volcanic activity and on public sector construction activity .
The UK has launched a three-year $ 122.8 million aid program to help reconstruct the economy .
Half of the island is expected to remain uninhabitable for another decade .
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez says he would welcome a visit by U.S. State Department official Thomas Shannon , but he says the diplomat should not come to cause problems .
Mr. Chavez made the comment in his weekly radio address Sunday .

Mr. Peretz said last week he would pull Labor out of the coaltion over differences in economic policy .
It is unclear whether Mr. Sharon will remain in Likud or form a new party before the polls .
A handgun once owned by Elvis Presley was stolen from a museum in the music titan 's home town of Memphis , Tennessee .
Authorities said the black , 9 mm Smith & Wesson pistol was stolen from a display case in the Elvis After Dark museum , across the street from Presley 's Graceland mansion .
A video camera caught a man removing the pistol from the display case around midnight .
The theft came to light on August 17 , when a visitor noticed an unfastened glass panel on the case .
Officials from Graceland , which owns the museum , subsequently viewed the video tape .
Presley died at Graceland on August 16 , 1977 , and is buried in a small garden beside the house .
Thousands of visitors from around the world have journeyed to Memphis to observe the 30th anniversary of his death .
Founded in the 12th century , the Principality of Muscovy , was able to emerge from over 200 years of Mongol domination ( 13th - 15th centuries ) and to gradually conquer and absorb surrounding principalities .
In the early 17th century , a new Romanov Dynasty continued this policy of expansion across Siberia to the Pacific .
Under PETER I ( ruled 1682 - 1725 ) , hegemony was extended to the Baltic Sea and the country was renamed the Russian Empire .
During the 19th century , more territorial acquisitions were made in Europe and Asia .
Defeat in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 - 05 contributed to the Revolution of 1905 , which resulted in the formation of a parliament and other reforms .
Repeated devastating defeats of the Russian army in World War I led to widespread rioting in the major cities of the Russian Empire and to the overthrow in 1917 of the imperial household .
The Communists under Vladimir LENIN seized power soon after and formed the USSR .
The brutal rule of Iosif STALIN ( 1928 - 53 ) strengthened Communist rule and Russian dominance of the Soviet Union at a cost of tens of millions of lives .
The Soviet economy and society stagnated in the following decades until General Secretary Mikhail GORBACHEV ( 1985 - 91 ) introduced glasnost ( openness ) and perestroika ( restructuring ) in an attempt to modernize Communism , but his initiatives inadvertently released forces that by December 1991 splintered the USSR into Russia and 14 other independent republics .
Since then , Russia has shifted its post-Soviet democratic ambitions in favor of a centralized semi-authoritarian state whose legitimacy is buttressed , in part , by carefully managed national elections , former President PUTIN 's genuine popularity , and the prudent management of Russia 's windfall energy wealth .
Russia has severely disabled a Chechen rebel movement , although violence still occurs throughout the North Caucasus .

The triple suicide bombings last month were the second major bomb attack on Bali after a blast three years ago killed 202 people .
Saudi Arabia has taken a firm stance with Syria , telling its president to begin fully removing his troops from Lebanon in accordance with a United Nations resolution , or Saudi-Syrian relations will suffer .
A Saudi official said Crown Prince Abdullah delivered the warning Thursday during a meeting in Riyadh with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad .
At the United Nations , Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he will be sending his special envoy , Terje Roed-Larsen , to Damascus and Beirut to discuss removing Syria 's 14,000 troops in accordance with U.N. Resolution 1559 .
Mr. Annan said he hopes to be able to report progress on the Syrian withdrawal to the Security Council in April .
In Beirut , pro-Syrian politicians ignored opposition demands for a full Syrian withdrawal as a pre-condition for joining the new government .
Instead they have called for dialogue through the formation of a national unity government .

Government security forces are battling pro-Taliban militants in the northwestern region .
Indonesia 's Health Ministry says a 29-year-old man has died of bird flu , the latest victim in the country hardest-hit by the virus .
The ministry said Saturday that the human death toll from the virus now stands at 74 .
However , World Health Organization officials have only recorded 63 deaths .
Indonesia only recently agreed to resume sharing its bird flu samples with the WHO , ending a four-month dispute .
Indonesia had refused to share the samples until the health organization guaranteed they would not be used to make expensive commercial vaccines .

Russian-born ice dancer Sergey Magerovskiy has become a United States citizen and is now eligible to compete with partner Tiffany Stiegler to represent the United States at the Turin Winter Olympics in February .
USA Figure Skating says Magerovskiy was sworn-in during a ceremony in Detroit on Wednesday .
In 2002 , he married American Rebecca Palmer , his former partner , and applied for naturalization under U.S. law after three years of marriage .

The economy depends largely on US military spending and tourism .
Total US grants , wage payments , and procurement outlays amounted to $ 1.3 billion in 2004 .
Over the past 30 years , the tourist industry has grown to become the largest income source following national defense .
The Guam economy continues to experience expansion in both its tourism and military sectors .
Tourism continues to dominate Antigua and Barbuda 's economy , accounting for nearly 60 % of GDP and 40 % of investment .
The dual-island nation 's agricultural production is focused on the domestic market and constrained by a limited water supply and a labor shortage stemming from the lure of higher wages in tourism and construction .
Manufacturing comprises enclave-type assembly for export with major products being bedding , handicrafts , and electronic components .
Prospects for economic growth in the medium term will continue to depend on tourist arrivals from the US , Canada , and Europe and potential damages from natural disasters .
After taking office in 2004 , the SPENCER government adopted an ambitious fiscal reform program , and was successful in reducing its public debt-to-GDP ratio from 120 % to about 90 % in 2008 .
However , the global financial crisis that began in 2008 , has led to a significant increase in the national debt , which topped 130 % at the end of 2010 .
The Antiguan economy experienced solid growth from 2003 to 2007 , reaching over 12 % in 2006 driven by a construction boom in hotels and housing associated with the Cricket World Cup , but growth dropped off in 2008 with the end of the boom .

The World Food Program says it has enough cereals to last until April , but will run out of other badly needed food items by the end of this month .
WFP officials said Saturday more aid must come within the next 10 days or the consequences will be catastrophic .
A spokesman ( Peter Smerdon ) says the WFP has received just $ 28 million of the $ 225 million needed for the Kenya program .
Kenyans have been dying of food shortages due to drought , and three-and-a-half million more people are on the brink of starvation .
At least 11 million people are facing starvation across East Africa .
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas met with Pope Benedict XVI at the Vatican Thursday .
The two men spoke privately for 15 minutes and addressed the subject of Mr. Abbas 's meeting last month with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Barack Obama in New York .
Mr. Abbas presented the Holy See with a piece of ceramic art depicting Jerusalem with the words " Jerusalem , Capital of Arab Culture " written on it in both Arabic and English .
Pope Benedict toured the Middle East in May of this year , where he met separately with Mr. Abbas and Mr. Netanyahu .
The pope has said Israel has the right to enjoy peace and security within its borders and the Palestinian people have a right to a sovereign independent homeland .
After his visit to the Middle East , the pontiff declared that peace in the region is possible .
Officials in the main Palestinian faction , Fatah , say jailed leader Marwan Barghouti has decided to run for Palestinian president .
But it remains unclear if the senior Fatah member will run as an independent .
The outspoken leader is serving five life sentences in an Israeli prison for the murder of five Israelis .
News of his intention to run surfaced Thursday , the same day that Fatah leaders confirmed former Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas as their candidate in the January 9 election .
Barghouti had earlier said he would not run if Fatah chose Mr. Abbas as its candidate .
In other developments , the Israeli army says two senior Hamas members were killed and a third wounded during an arrest operation in the West Bank town of Hebron .
Pope Benedict has opened four days of ceremonies leading to the Christian observance of Easter , with a call for the faithful to find true freedom by submitting to the will of God .
Benedict 's Holy Thursday plea came at a mass that included participation by clergy from the diocese of Rome .

The pontiff will celebrate a second mass later Thursday , commemorating the biblical Last Supper of Jesus and his apostles .
During that ceremony , the pope will symbolically wash the feet of 12 men .
Christian liturgy says Jesus washed the feet of his 12 apostles on the evening before his crucifixion .
On Easter Sunday -- the holiest day of the Christian calendar -- Christians will commemorate what they believe was the resurrection of Jesus .

Haiti is a free market economy that enjoys the advantages of low labor costs and tariff-free access to the US for many of its exports .
Poverty , corruption , and poor access to education for much of the population are among Haiti 's most serious disadvantages .
Over the longer term , Haiti needs to create jobs for its young workforce and to build institutional capacity .
Haiti 's economy suffered a severe setback when a 7.0 magnitude earthquake destroyed much of its capital city , Port-au-Prince , and neighboring areas in January 2010 .
Already the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere with 80 % of the population living under the poverty line and 54 % in abject poverty , the damage to Port-au-Prince caused the country 's GDP to contract an estimated 5.1 % in 2010 .
Two-thirds of all Haitians depend on the agricultural sector , mainly small-scale subsistence farming , and remain vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters , exacerbated by the country 's widespread deforestation .
US economic engagement under the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement ( HOPE ) Act , passed in December 2006 , has boosted apparel exports and investment by providing duty-free access to the US .
Congress voted in 2010 to extend the legislation until 2020 under the Haitian Economic Lift Act ( HELP ) ; the apparel sector accounts for three-quarters of Haitian exports and nearly one-tenth of GDP .
Remittances are the primary source of foreign exchange , equaling nearly 20 % of GDP and more than twice the earnings from exports .
Haiti suffers from a lack of investment , partly because of limited infrastructure and a lack of security .

The Netherlands economy is noted for stable industrial relations , moderate unemployment and inflation , a sizable current account surplus , and an important role as a European transportation hub .
Industrial activity is predominantly in food processing , chemicals , petroleum refining , and electrical machinery .
A highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 % of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports .
The Netherlands , along with 11 of its EU partners , began circulating the euro currency on 1 January 2002 .
The country has been one of the leading European nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the US .
After 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth , the Netherlands ' economy - which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services - was hard-hit by global economic crisis .
Dutch GDP contracted 3.9 % in 2009 , while exports declined nearly 25 % due to a sharp contraction in world demand .
The Dutch financial sector has also suffered , due in part to the high exposure of some Dutch banks to U.S. mortgage-backed securities .
In response to turmoil in financial markets , the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third , to prevent further systemic risk .
The government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs , offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers , and expanding export credit facilities .

With unemployment weighing on private-sector consumption , the government of Prime Minister Mark RUTTE is likely to come under increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check while promoting economic recovery .

The bank raised the money after reporting first quarter profits of $ 1.66 billion , far more than expected .
Goldman Sachs is eager to pay all of the $ 10 billion it received from the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program , as soon as the government approves .
It would be the first major U.S. bank to repay federal loans handed out last year to try to keep the institutions running .
If Goldman Sachs repays the debt , it would not have to abide by government restrictions , such as limits on executive pay .
Some analysts say the government may not want Goldman Sachs to repay its loan so soon , because it could pressure other banks to settle their debt before they are financially stable .

Because of declining reserves , Muscat has actively pursued a development plan that focuses on diversification , industrialization , and privatization , with the objective of reducing the oil sector 's contribution to GDP to 9 % by 2020 .
Tourism and gas-based industries are key components of the government 's diversification strategy .
By using enhanced oil recovery techniques , Oman succeeded in increasing oil production , giving the country more time to diversify , and the increase in global oil prices throughout 2010 provides the government greater financial resources to invest in non-oil sectors .
A key partner in Sri Lanka 's ruling coalition has threatened to quit if Colombo joins with Tamil Tiger rebels in distributing aid to tsunami survivors in rebel-held areas .
The Marxist People 's Liberation Front , which holds a crucial 39 seats in the 225-member parliament , said it opposes a joint mechanism to distribute relief aid .
The threat came as Norway 's peace-broker Erik Solheim held talks with the rebels about aid distribution in a fresh bid to revive the country 's faltering peace process .
The joint mechanism is designed to make it possible for international tsunami aid to reach rebel-held areas .
It could also lay the foundation for an end to Sri Lanka 's civil war .
The December tsunami disaster killed more than 30,000 Sri Lankans and left many more homeless .

Under a new order decreed by President Pervez Musharraf last month , all madrassas are required to register by the end of this year or close down .
An alliance spokesman says the new law is discriminatory because it does not require other religious seminaries to register .
The madrassas also argue that donors will stop giving them money if they release their names , as required by the new law .
Authorities say they suspect some of the madrassas have been breeding grounds for Islamist militants .
President Musharraf decreed the new law after revelations that at least one of the four bombers in the July seventh attacks on London had visited a Pakistani madrassa just before the attack .

South Korean defense officials say North Korea is deploying massive numbers of troops and arms near the capital of Pyongyang .
South Korea 's defense ministry said in a report to Parliament Tuesday that the large numbers of soldiers , armored vehicles and artillery have been stationed near the Stalinist state 's capital since mid-July .

North Korea-watchers say the massing of military assets could be for a parade or to provide security for the events .
Some analysts say North Korean leader Kim Jong Il will probably designate his youngest son Kim Jong Un as his successor at the September meeting , only the third such gathering since the communist state was founded in 1948 .

But President Bush says he thinks Mr. Bolton will take a strong leadership role at the U.N.
Democrats in the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate have announced they will launch investigative hearings into what they view as problems in the Bush administration .
Senate Democrats say the hearings are necessary because Senate Republicans have abdicated their responsibility for oversight of the administration 's policies and use of taxpayer money .
Democratic Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota said the first hearing will be in January .
He said a possible target of the hearings is alleged contract abuses in Iraq .
Other topics could include pre-war intelligence on Iraq and the Abu Ghraib prison scandal .
The Democratic-organized hearings will not have subpoena powers , but Senator Dorgan said he believes there will be " plenty of whistleblowers " ready to speak out against the administration .
When the new Congress convenes in January , Republicans will have an expanded majority of 55 senators , leaving Democrats with less influence .

A U.S. newspaper says the American military in Iraq is secretly paying Iraqi newspapers to print stories highlighting the work of U.S. and Iraqi troops and denouncing insurgents .
The Los Angeles Times reports Wednesday that the articles are written by American soldiers but are presented to Iraqi media as unbiased accounts from independent journalists .
The Times says the stories are translated and placed in Iraqi newspapers with the help of an American defense contractor , the Lincoln Group .
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman says the allegations are being investigated , and if they are true , some of them are troubling and could violate Pentagon policy .
Iraqi editors and journalists interviewed for the Times article reacted with a mixture of surprise and indifference when told about the alleged origin of the stories .

Talks between the two sides broke down in August , when Tehran rejected a European offer of economic and political incentives in return for scrapping its nuclear fuel program .
Instead , Tehran resumed uranium conversion activities , and the International Atomic Energy Agency declared Tehran was not cooperating with nuclear inspectors as required under international treaty .
The Iranian Foreign Ministry said Sunday that Tehran allowed IAEA inspectors access to a high-security military site last week , to counter U.S. suspicions it is trying to develop nuclear weapons .

Britain conquered Burma over a period of 62 years ( 1824 - 1886 ) and incorporated it into its Indian Empire .
Burma was administered as a province of India until 1937 when it became a separate , self-governing colony ; independence from the Commonwealth was attained in 1948 .
Gen. NE WIN dominated the government from 1962 to 1988 , first as military ruler , then as self-appointed president , and later as political kingpin .
In September 1988 , the military deposed NE WIN and established a new ruling junta .
Despite multiparty legislative elections in 1990 that resulted in the main opposition party - the National League for Democracy ( NLD ) - winning a landslide victory , the junta refused to hand over power .
NLD leader and Nobel Peace Prize recipient AUNG SAN SUU KYI , who was under house arrest from 1989 to 1995 and 2000 to 2002 , was imprisoned in May 2003 and subsequently transferred to house arrest .
She was finally released in November 2010 .
After the ruling junta in August 2007 unexpectedly increased fuel prices , tens of thousands of Burmese marched in protest , led by prodemocracy activists and Buddhist monks .
In late September 2007 , the government brutally suppressed the protests , killing at least 13 people and arresting thousands for participating in the demonstrations .
Since then , the regime has continued to raid homes and monasteries and arrest persons suspected of participating in the pro-democracy protests .
Burma in early May 2008 was struck by Cyclone Nargis , which claimed over 138,000 dead and tens of thousands injured and homeless .
Despite this tragedy , the junta proceeded with its May constitutional referendum , the first vote in Burma since 1990 .
Parliamentary elections held in November 2010 , considered flawed by many in the international community , saw the junta 's Union Solidarity and Development Party garnering over 75 % of the seats .
Parliament convened in January 2011 and selected former Prime Minister THEIN SEIN as president .
The vast majority of national-level appointees named by THEIN SEIN are former or current military officers .

He said there are reports that more than 500 bodies are in the grave .
Officials believe they were defeated soldiers of Soviet-backed President Najibullah , who were killed after they surrendered to the mujahedin fighters .
Mr. Najibullah was executed later by the Taleban in 1996 .
If proven true , it would be the first mass grave found in Afghanistan containing communist soldiers .
Other graves have been found with the bodies of thousands of anti-communist mujahedin fighters .

Grenada relies on tourism as its main source of foreign exchange especially since the construction of an international airport in 1985 .
Hurricanes Ivan ( 2004 ) and Emily ( 2005 ) severely damaged the agricultural sector - particularly nutmeg and cocoa cultivation - which had been a key driver of economic growth .
Grenada has rebounded from the devastating effects of the hurricanes but is now saddled with the debt burden from the rebuilding process .
Public debt-to-GDP is nearly 110 % , leaving the THOMAS administration limited room to engage in public investments and social spending .
Strong performances in construction and manufacturing , together with the development of tourism and an offshore financial industry , have also contributed to growth in national output ; however , economic growth was stagnant in 2010 after a sizeable contraction in 2009 , because of the global economic slowdown 's effects on tourism and remittances .
Russia 's state-owned natural gas firm Gazprom has announced plans to buy a controlling stake in the Russian daily Izvestia .
A spokesman for Gazprom media says negotiations are almost complete , with an announcement in coming days .
The Vedomosti business daily quotes industry officials as speculating the deal could be worth between $ 10 million to $ 20 million .
Critics call the move a Kremlin effort to tighten its influence on the media .

An editor at Izvestia resigned last year in what he said was a dispute over the newspaper 's coverage of the Beslan school crisis in which more than 330 people were killed .
He said he was forced to resign over coverage the paper 's leadership deemed too shocking .
The newspaper printed graphic pictures of the bloody siege .
Some speculated that coverage upset the Kremlin .

Those quotas filled so quickly that millions of items of Chinese-made clothing were left stranded at customs checkpoints .
Mr. Mandelson Tuesday said the economic consequences of not allowing the goods to enter Europe will be severe for small retailers .
He said delaying the shipments could also cause higher prices and shortages in the next few months .
EU textile producers say the imports are harming their business , but retailers say they have already paid for the Chinese clothing and want the items released .

ALL the Goods were once driven out by the Ills from that common share which they each had in the affairs of mankind ; for the Ills by reason of their numbers had prevailed to possess the earth .
The Goods wafted themselves to heaven and asked for a righteous vengeance on their persecutors .
They entreated Jupiter that they might no longer be associated with the Ills , as they had nothing in common and could not live together , but were engaged in unceasing warfare ; and that an indissoluble law might be laid down for their future protection .
Jupiter granted their request and decreed that henceforth the Ills should visit the earth in company with each other , but that the Goods should one by one enter the habitations of men .
Hence it arises that Ills abound , for they come not one by one , but in troops , and by no means singly : while the Goods proceed from Jupiter , and are given , not alike to all , but singly , and separately ; and one by one to those who are able to discern them .

China 's banks doled out $ 156 billion in new loans in the first quarter , more than half the target for all of 2006 .
The Chinese economy is growing at a rapid pace , topping nine percent in the last two years .
Leaders are concerned the pace could raise inflation rates or lead to investment in unnecessary projects .
The central bank said the growth of the broad money supply rose nearly 19 percent on a year-on-year basis to $ 3.9 trillion by the end of March .

The two sides reached the deal January 4 , after a three-day suspension of Russian gas deliveries to Ukraine .
The agreement triggered a political crisis in Ukraine , and parliament voted to dismiss the government .

Boucher is attending an international conference in Berlin on the reconstruction of Afghanistan .
Last week , the Bush administration announced it would spend more than $ 10 billion in Afghanistan for security and reconstruction .
A U.S.-based human rights group says recently gathered information could lead to new charges against a notorious former Iraqi general who is accused of ordering the 1988 massacre of Kurds in northern Iraq .
In a report issued Thursday , Human Rights Watch says the new information implicates Ali Hassan al-Majid - known as " Chemical Ali " - in the execution of hundreds of Shi'ite Muslims during an uprising in the southern city of Basra in 1999 .
Iraqi officials say they expect Chemical Ali to be among the first of several top lieutenants of Saddam Hussein 's regime to go on trial for a range of crimes , including crimes against humanity and genocide .
In December , Iraq 's interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi said the trials of top officials of the ousted regime would begin within weeks .
But so far , no trial dates have been set .

Iran 's top nuclear negotiator says Tehran will soon resume large-scale enrichment of uranium if Iran is referred to the United Nations Security Council .
Ali Larijani also told a news conference Wednesday that Iran 's main enrichment plant is ready for use .
He said all Iran has to do is inform the International Atomic Energy Agency that it would be resuming operations .
His comments come one day before the IAEA board meets in Vienna .
A draft resolution obtained by news agencies formally calls on the IAEA to report Iran to the U.N. Security Council over its nuclear activities .

Georgia 's economy sustained GDP growth of more than 10 % in 2006 - 07 , based on strong inflows of foreign investment and robust government spending .
However , GDP growth slowed in 2008 following the August 2008 conflict with Russia , and turned negative in 2009 as foreign direct investment and workers ' remittances declined in the wake of the global financial crisis , but rebounded in 2010 .
Georgia 's main economic activities include the cultivation of agricultural products such as grapes , citrus fruits , and hazelnuts ; mining of manganese and copper ; and output of a small industrial sector producing alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages , metals , machinery , aircraft and chemicals .
Areas of recent improvement include growth in the construction , banking services , and mining sectors , but reduced availability of external investment and the slowing regional economy are emerging risks .
The country imports nearly all its needed supplies of natural gas and oil products .
It has sizeable hydropower capacity , a growing component of its energy supplies .
Georgia has overcome the chronic energy shortages and gas supply interruptions of the past by renovating hydropower plants and by increasingly relying on natural gas imports from Azerbaijan instead of from Russia .
The construction on the Baku-T'bilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline , the Baku-T'bilisi-Erzerum gas pipeline , and the Kars-Akhalkalaki Railroad are part of a strategy to capitalize on Georgia 's strategic location between Europe and Asia and develop its role as a transit point for gas , oil and other goods .
Georgia has historically suffered from a chronic failure to collect tax revenues ; however , the government , since coming to power in 2004 , has simplified the tax code , improved tax administration , increased tax enforcement , and cracked down on petty corruption .
However , the economic downturn of 2008 - 09 eroded the tax base and led to a decline in the budget surplus and an increase in public borrowing needs .
The country is pinning its hopes for renewed growth on a determined effort to continue to liberalize the economy by reducing regulation , taxes , and corruption in order to attract foreign investment , but the economy faces a more difficult investment climate both domestically and internationally .

After discarding socialist economic policies in the mid-1990s , Madagascar followed a World Bank- and IMF-led policy of privatization and liberalization that has been undermined since the start of the political crisis .
This strategy placed the country on a slow and steady growth path from an extremely low level .
Agriculture , including fishing and forestry , is a mainstay of the economy , accounting for more than one-fourth of GDP and employing 80 % of the population .
Exports of apparel have boomed in recent years primarily due to duty-free access to the US .
However , Madagascar 's failure to comply with the requirements of the African Growth and Opportunity Act ( AGOA ) led to the termination of the country 's duty-free access in January 2010 .
Deforestation and erosion , aggravated by the use of firewood as the primary source of fuel , are serious concerns .

The men have said they were tortured into confessing to the crimes .
The Israeli cabinet has postponed a vote to open a key border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt .
Israeli radio linked the delay to a disagreement over the role of European security monitors at the Rafah crossing .
Last week , the Israeli security cabinet voted to reopen the crossing under Egyptian and Palestinian control , with Europeans monitoring the flow of people .
But the radio report says the European Union is balking at Israel 's demand that its monitors arrest anyone suspected of arms smuggling .
Israeli forces left the Gaza Strip in September after a 38-year occupation , but they still control the borders of the Palestinian territory .
European delegates and Israeli negotiators met Sunday in Jerusalem in a push to resolve the dispute .
The Europeans are to meet with Palestinians later in the day and Monday in Ramallah and Gaza City .

Caracas has been trying , unsuccessfully , to get those restrictions removed and threatens to limit U.S. flights as of March 30 .
The Venezuelan ban would put an end to flights between the two countries by Continental Airlines and Delta Air Lines and restrict some by American Airlines .
Canada 's Food Inspection Agency - which confirmed the results Sunday - had suspected last week the cow was infected with the disease based on preliminary testing .
The agency said at the time that human food and animal feed supplies were not affected .
The confirmation comes just days after the United States announced plans to reopen its border in March to nearly all Canadian beef and live cattle .
U.S. officials banned the import of Canadian cattle in May , 2003 , after Canada found its first case of the disease .
Mad cow disease attacks the central nervous system of cattle and can be harmful to humans if tainted meat is consumed .

Mexican authorities are investigating a report that a violent drug cartel has obtained anti-aircraft missiles that could be used to kill President Vicente Fox .
The Mexican newspaper El~Universal says a U.S.-based private intelligence firm , Stratfor , has issued a report saying the Soviet-era weapons were purchased on the black market by a group of ex-Mexican army commandoes now working with drug traffickers .
The weapons were said to have been first acquired by Nicaragua during its civil war in the 1980s , and some could have been passed on to drug-smuggling groups .
A Mexican prosecutor says the report lacks credibility , but says his country is contacting U.S. authorities to determine if the report is true , or , in his words , " taken from a movie script . "
President Fox has launched a massive crackdown on drug traffickers to combat a surge of drug-related violence .

Last week EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said the bloc should have an open debate on Turkey 's candidacy .
But British Prime Minister Tony Blair warned against shutting the EU to new members like Turkey , remarks welcomed by Mr. Erdogan .
Opposition to the largely Muslim nation 's membership in the European bloc contributed to the defeat of the EU constitution in recent referenda in France and the Netherlands .

He said the shots were fired by assailants from a car in the capital , Bishkek .
Mr. Erkinbayev said he believed that his candidacy was the reason for the attack , but a Kyrgyz police official said the shooting may not have been politically motivated .
A wealthy businessman from southern Kyrgyzstan , Mr. Erkinbayev and his supporters were the catalyst behind mass popular protests which forced former President Askar Akayev from office on March 24 .
Bishkek mayor and former security chief Felix Kulov and interim President Kurmanbek Bakiyev are considered the front-runners in the July presidential elections .
Present day Benin was the site of Dahomey , a prominent West African kingdom that rose in the 15th century .
The territory became a French Colony in 1872 and achieved independence on 1 August 1960 , as the Republic of Benin .
A succession of military governments ended in 1972 with the rise to power of Mathieu KEREKOU and the establishment of a government based on Marxist-Leninist principles .
A move to representative government began in 1989 .
Two years later , free elections ushered in former Prime Minister Nicephore SOGLO as president , marking the first successful transfer of power in Africa from a dictatorship to a democracy .
KEREKOU was returned to power by elections held in 1996 and 2001 , though some irregularities were alleged .
KEREKOU stepped down at the end of his second term in 2006 and was succeeded by Thomas YAYI Boni , a political outsider and independent .
YAYI has attempted to stem corruption and has strongly promoted accelerating Benin 's economic growth .

Earlier this year , surgeons in France performed the world 's first partial face transplant on a woman whose lips and nose were ripped off by a dog .
One of the poorest countries in the world , Guinea-Bissau 's legal economy depends mainly on farming and fishing , but trafficking narcotics is probably the most lucrative trade .
Cashew crops have increased remarkably in recent years .
Guinea-Bissau exports fish and seafood along with small amounts of peanuts , palm kernels , and timber .
Rice is the major crop and staple food .
However , intermittent fighting between Senegalese-backed government troops and a military junta destroyed much of the country 's infrastructure and caused widespread damage to the economy in 1998 ; the civil war led to a 28 % drop in GDP that year , with partial recovery in 1999 - 2002 .
In December 2003 , the World Bank , IMF , and UNDP were forced to step in to provide emergency budgetary support in the amount of $ 107 million for 2004 , representing over 80 % of the total national budget .
The combination of limited economic prospects , a weak and faction-ridden government , and favorable geography have made this West African country a way station for drugs bound for Europe .
The U.S. military says four American soldiers have died in separate attacks in Baghdad .
Three of the soldiers were killed Monday in east Baghdad , where U.S. and Iraqi troops have waged intense battles with Shi'ite militiamen .
The fourth soldier was killed by indirect fire during a separate incident in western Baghdad .

The casualties came during a combined air and ground assault launched in response to small arms fire directed at U.S. troops .
On Sunday , Iraqi and American troops killed 38 suspected militants in Baghdad , in the fiercest fighting in weeks .
Officials said gunmen took advantage of a sandstorm that blanketed the Iraqi capital to launch apparently coordinated assaults .
The sandstorm grounded American helicopters , the main weapon used by U.S. forces to hunt insurgent rocket-launching crews .
The head of Iran 's nuclear negotiators has warned that the country 's incoming president may reverse an agreement to freeze uranium enrichment activities .
Hassan Rohani told an Iranian daily he believes elected President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will remain committed to nuclear talks with the European Union .
But he says the new president has a different view on the enrichment freeze , and may implement a change in a new round of talks with EU diplomats next month .
Tuesday , Mr. Ahmadinejad vowed " new measures " in nuclear talks when he takes over Iran 's government on August 3 .
EU officials have been offering economic incentives if Iran agrees to end uranium enrichment , amid fears the Islamic Republic may develop a nuclear weapon .
Tehran insists its program is for peaceful ends .
A new public opinion poll finds President Bush 's approval rating sinking to an all-time low .
Only 39 percent of those surveyed in the Washington Post-ABC News poll said they approve of the president 's overall job performance .
That figure is down from 42 percent in the Post-ABC poll last month , and down from 52 percent the week of Mr. Bush 's second inauguration in January .
The poll of 600 Americans was taken Friday and Saturday , after former top White House aide Lewis Libby was indicted on criminal charges related to the probe into who leaked the identity of a secret CIA operative .

Forty-one percent said the case was an " isolated incident . "
The survey has a four-point margin of error .
The leader of Nepal 's Maoist insurgency says he thinks the king will ultimately be exiled or executed to make way for a republic in the world 's only Hindu monarchy .
In a BBC television interview broadcast Monday , top Nepali communist leader Prachanda said King Gyanendra , who seized total power a year ago , had not left any room for compromise .
The reclusive 52-year-old Prachanda has been living underground ( in hiding ) for more than two decades .
Last year , he forged a loose alliance with the main political parties to topple the king and restore democracy .
The Maoists have been fighting since 1996 to overthrow Nepal 's government and install communist rule , a war that has killed about 13,000 people and shattered the economy .
Pakistan 's Supreme Court has declared unconstitutional a bill passed by a staunchly Islamic province to enforce Islamic values on society with the help of so-called religious police .
The Supreme Court ordered the governor of North West Frontier Province not to sign the bill in its present form .
The bill was passed by the provincial assembly where hardline religious parties are in a majority .
But it must be approved by the provincial governor , who is appointed by Islamabad , before it can become law .
The issue was referred to the Supreme Court by President Pervez Musharraf who has vowed to rid society of Muslim extremism .
The court spent four days on the federal government 's challenge to the legislation .
The nine-member bench ruled that many of the provisions in the bill violate the country 's 1973 constitution .
Tropical depression Gamma is expected to dissipate Monday after battering the coasts of Honduras and Belize , killing at least 14 people .
In the storm 's wake , U.S. military helicopters have joined Honduran aircraft in flying aid to survivors along the Caribbean coast who have been cut off by flooding and mudslides .
At least 11 people in Honduras have died and 13 others are missing .

Relatives say he was hospitalized a week ago , but gave no further details about his condition .
Rohmer 's films explored relationships and love affairs from a philosophical perspective .
Rohmer achieved critical acclaim in the late 1960s and early 1970s with films such as My Night at Maud 's and Claire 's Knee .
French President Nicholas Sarkozy said the filmmaker created the " Rohmer style " that will survive for years to come .
The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency says Iran is insisting that some of its uranium enrichment centrifuges be exempt from a freeze of its nuclear program .
Mohamed ElBaradei told reporters in Vienna Thursday , that he would report to the IAEA board that Iran has frozen most of its uranium enrichment activity , except for 20 centrifuges .
Iran 's new request is partial reversal of a recent agreement with the European Union to suspend all enrichment activity .
The IAEA chief says said he hopes the dispute will soon be resolved .
The IAEA board is meeting to decide whether to refer Iran to the U.N. Security Council for possible sanctions over its nuclear program .
The United States says Iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons - a charge Iran denies .

Earlier this week , Mr. Fujimori left Japan after five years in exile and flew to Chile with the intention of returning to Peru to run for president next year .
He was arrested in Chile at Peru 's request .
Mr. Fujimori fled to Japan in 2000 amid charges of corruption and human rights abuses stemming from his 10 years in office .
Mr. Fujimori is recognized as a citizen in Japan , which refused to extradite him to Peru .

Mr. Annan will speak at a previously-scheduled U.N.-sponsored meeting in Qatar Sunday on how to bring civilizations closer together .
The 12 cartoons first appeared in a Danish newspaper in September and have been reprinted in other European newspapers .
One of the cartoons depicts Muhammad as a terrorist .
Islam forbids any depictions of the prophet .
Astronauts at the International Space Station have completed the second spacewalk of five , during the shuttle Endeavour 's 11-day mission at the station .
Astronauts Dave Wolf and Tom Marshburn undertook a 6-hour , 53-minute spacewalk Monday to conduct maintenance work at the station .
The walk coincided with the 40th anniversary of man 's landing on the moon .
Wolf and astronaut Tim Kopra completed the first spacewalk of the mission during a 5.5-hour operation Saturday .
They installed an external platform on the massive Japanese lab at the space station .
The lab is known as Kibo , or " hope . "
The platform will allow scientists to conduct experiments in the vacuum of space .
With the shuttle crew 's visit , there are 13 astronauts aboard the space station , the most ever .
Kopra is taking the place of Japan 's Koichi Wakata , who has been on the space station since March .
A new United Nations report by some of the world 's top scientists says global warming is " very likely " man-made and that the world can expect higher temperatures , rising sea levels , and erratic weather .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will formally release its report Friday in Paris , where experts from more than 100 nations have been meeting .
The panel defines the term " very likely " as meaning there is a 90 percent chance that man-made pollutants are causing the Earth to warm up .
A draft of the report forecasts global temperatures rising up to four degrees Celsius by the end of the century .
Some scientists believe natural weather patterns may be causing climate change and say the future will not be as dire as some experts predict .
Former U.S. President George W. Bush , in a rare public appearance , said Saturday the mission in Afghanistan is " necessary for peace and stability . "
Speaking at a leadership conference in India 's capital , New Delhi , Mr. Bush warned that if the Taliban and al-Qaida take control of Afghanistan , the people there will " face a return to a brutal tyranny . "
Mr. Bush ordered U.S. troops into Afghanistan in late 2001 , after the September 11 attacks on the United States .
The invasion to fight militants quickly ousted the hardline Taliban government .
The former president has made few public appearances since leaving office in January .
A roadside explosion in southern Afghanistan has ripped through a coalition convoy , killing one Romanian soldier and wounding another .
It was not immediately clear if the explosion was from a recently planted device , or the vehicle ran over ordinance from a past conflict .
Earlier reports indicated the blast late Sunday near the city of Kandahar killed an Afghan soldier .
But the U.S. military later confirmed the explosion hit a vehicle with Romanian soldiers inside .
In a separate incident Sunday , in the capital , Kabul , a car bomb exploded on a road near a crowded residential area , causing material damage but no injuries .
Interior Ministry spokesman , Lutfullah Mashal , told reporters at the scene , the explosion was the work of the enemies of peace and stability .
Hungary has made the transition from a centrally planned to a market economy , with a per capita income nearly two-thirds that of the EU-25 average .
The private sector accounts for more than 80 % of GDP .
Foreign ownership of and investment in Hungarian firms are widespread , with cumulative foreign direct investment worth more than $ 70 billion .
The government 's austerity measures , imposed since late 2006 , have reduced the budget deficit from over 9 % of GDP in 2006 to 3.2 % in 2010 , with a target of less than 3 % in 2011 .
Hungary 's impending inability to service its short-term debt - brought on by the global financial crisis in late 2008 - led Budapest to obtain an IMF/EU/World Bank-arranged financial assistance package worth over $ 25 billion .
The global economic downturn , declining exports , and low domestic consumption and fixed asset accumulation , dampened by government austerity measures , resulted in an economic contraction of 6.3 % in 2009 .
In 2010 the new government implemented a number of changes including cutting business and personal income taxes , but imposed " crisis taxes " on financial institutions , energy and telecom companies , and retailers .
The economy rebounded in 2010 with a big boost from exports , especially to Germany , and growth of more than 2.5 % is expected in 2011 .
Unemployment remained high , at more than 10 % in 2010 .
The inhabitants have traditionally earned their livelihood by fishing and by servicing fishing fleets operating off the coast of Newfoundland .
The economy has been declining , however , because of disputes with Canada over fishing quotas and a steady decline in the number of ships stopping at Saint Pierre .
In 1992 , an arbitration panel awarded the islands an exclusive economic zone of 12,348 sq km to settle a longstanding territorial dispute with Canada , although it represents only 25 % of what France had sought .
France heavily subsidizes the islands to the great betterment of living standards .
The government hopes an expansion of tourism will boost economic prospects .
Fish farming , crab fishing , and agriculture are being developed to diversify the local economy .
Recent test drilling for oil may pave the way for development of the energy sector .
The Tibetan spiritual leader who teaches age-old principles of peace and tolerance has gone high-tech , joining the online messaging service Twitter .
The Dalai Lama 's office in India set up a Twitter account this week under the name @dalailama .
The Buddhist leader has not personally written any messages , but his office has posted Web links to the Dalai Lama 's interviews and photos during his visit to the United States .
The Dalai Lama signed up for his online account Monday , a day after meeting Twitter founder Evan Williams in Los Angeles , California .
Williams says the Dalai Lama laughed at the idea of using the social network service .
But as of Tuesday , the spiritual leader has attracted 69,000 followers .
The Dalai Lama was in Florida Tuesday giving a speech on global compassion .
An environmental organization says several countries are refusing to cooperate with an investigation of the deadly strain of bird flu .
Dutch-based Wetlands International is the non-governmental agency commissioned by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization to research H5N1 in wild birds .
Wetlands International says Iran , Nigeria , Sudan , Tunisia and Turkey have refused to grant access to researchers .
The organization says it believes the refusals are the result of concerns by those countries about the potential impact on poultry exports and tourism if the virus is found in wild birds .
Meanwhile , European Union countries are dealing with millions of dollars in lost revenue as demand for poultry products falls off sharply .
Bird flu has spread from Asia to Europe , Africa and the Mideast , killing 94 people since 2003 .
The World Health Organization has reported another bird flu death in Indonesia , confirming Monday that a five-year-old boy who died last month was infected with the virus .
Officials said the victim died June 16 in East Java province .
He was believed to have come into contact with infected chickens .
Scientists have diagnosed more than 120 bird flu fatalities since late 2003 .
Most of them have been in Asia .
Scientists worry that human-to-human transmission of the virus could spark a global pandemic .
In late June , the WHO said it believed one Indonesian family became infected through such human-to-human transmission .
But health officials say that the specific H5N1 virus strain that killed seven of eight family members died out with its last victim .
Sri Lankan government negotiators and Tamil Tiger rebels have agreed to resume their cease-fire talks in April and to restrain the level of violence between them .
Norwegian mediator Erik Solheim said the agreement came during two days of talks in Geneva that ended Thursday .
Earlier , Solheim had played down expectations of a breakthrough , saying confidence was low .
Sri Lanka wants to make some changes to a 2002 ceasefire accord signed by the rebels .
But the Tamil rebels say they will only discuss implementing the existing ceasefire deal .
Both sides blame the other for a surge in violence in December and January that killed at least 150 people .
In the latest incident , Sri Lanka 's military accuses Tamil rebels of killing a Muslim man in the east of the country on Wednesday .
The economy was formerly based on agriculture , mainly sheep farming , but today fishing contributes the bulk of economic activity .
In 1987 , the government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers operating within the Falkland Islands ' exclusive fishing zone .
These license fees total more than $ 40 million per year , which help support the island 's health , education , and welfare system .
Squid accounts for 75 % of the fish taken .
Dairy farming supports domestic consumption ; crops furnish winter fodder .
Foreign exchange earnings come from shipments of high-grade wool to the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins .
The islands are now self-financing except for defense .
The British Geological Survey announced a 200-mile oil exploration zone around the islands in 1993 , and early seismic surveys suggest substantial reserves capable of producing 500,000 barrels per day ; to date , no exploitable site has been identified .
An agreement between Argentina and the UK in 1995 seeks to defuse licensing and sovereignty conflicts that would dampen foreign interest in exploiting potential oil reserves .
Political tensions between the UK and Argentina rose in early 2010 after a UK company began oil drilling activities in the waters around the Falkland Islands but abated somewhat when the drilling operation failed to discover commercially exploitable oil reserves .
Tourism , especially eco-tourism , is increasing rapidly , with about 30,000 visitors in 2001 .
Another large source of income is interest paid on money the government has in the bank .
The British military presence also provides a sizeable economic boost .
Tajikistan and the United Nations are appealing for $ 5.3 million in international aid following deadly floods and mudslides that killed at least 40 people .
The U.N. Resident Coordinator in Tajikistan , Michael Jones , launched the appeal Wednesday to provide relief to the thousands affected by the May 7 flash floods in the town of Kulyab and surrounding districts .
The floods , and resulting mudslides , displaced 4,500 people and destroyed homes , schools and roads .
At least 33 people remain missing .
Jones said Tajikistan was counting on the international community 's help to support those displaced and the affected communities .
The U.N. appeal includes projects aimed at providing food and basic social services to those living in tents .
The plan also intends to restore drinking water and sanitation in Kulyab and surrounding areas .
The mountainous country is impacted by mudslides every year as snow begins to thaw in the spring .
President Bush has again urged Congress to approve his plan for adding private investment accounts to the national retirement system known as Social Security .
In Saturday 's weekly radio address , Mr. Bush repeated his warning that the system will soon run short of money because the amount collected in taxes is far less than the money needed to pay benefits .
He stressed that if Congress does not act , the government could be forced to dramatically increase taxes , borrow money or reduce Social Security benefits .
Under Mr. Bush 's plan , younger workers would be able to divert some of their Social Security taxes into private accounts that could be invested in stocks or bonds .
Speaking for the opposition Democratic party , US Senator Charles Schumer , of New York said the federal retirement program only needs fine-tuning .
He said Mr. Bush 's plan will not fix the system 's long-term financial problems .
World-renowned Russian choreographer Igor Moiseyev has died at the age of 101 .
Russian news media reports say Moiseyev died Friday of heart failure in Moscow .
President Vladimir Putin expressed his condolences to relatives and colleagues .
Moiseyev established his professional folk dance group , the Moiseyev Dance Company , in 1937 and remained at its helm for six decades .
Soviet leaders favored the choreographer , although he was not a member of the Communist Party .
His dance group was one of the first permitted to travel abroad .
Moiseyev 's innovative choreography combined balletic movement with traditional folk steps .

The EU said it is particularly troubled by the repression of Iranians who try to freely express opinions , especially those in minority Arab and Kurd regions .
Lithuanian lands were united under MINDAUGAS in 1236 ; over the next century , through alliances and conquest , Lithuania extended its territory to include most of present-day Belarus and Ukraine .
By the end of the 14th century Lithuania was the largest state in Europe .
An alliance with Poland in 1386 led the two countries into a union through the person of a common ruler .
In 1569 , Lithuania and Poland formally united into a single dual state , the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth .
This entity survived until 1795 when its remnants were partitioned by surrounding countries .
Lithuania regained its independence following World War I but was annexed by the USSR in 1940 - an action never recognized by the US and many other countries .
On 11 March 1990 , Lithuania became the first of the Soviet republics to declare its independence , but Moscow did not recognize this proclamation until September of 1991 ( following the abortive coup in Moscow ) .
The last Russian troops withdrew in 1993 .
Lithuania subsequently restructured its economy for integration into Western European institutions ; it joined both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004 .
The top U.N. envoy to Sudan , Jan Pronk , says he is horrified by ongoing violence in Darfur and called on the government to stop the killing .
In Khartoum Wednesday , Mr. Pronk said he saw evidence of widespread atrocities during his tour of Darfur last week .
He specifically mentioned Labado , a village in South Darfur , the scene of recent fighting between rebels and government forces .

Egypt attempted to colonize the region of southern Sudan by establishing the province of Equatoria in the 1870s .
Islamic Mahdist revolutionaries overran the region in 1885 , but in 1898 a British force was able to overthrow the Mahdist regime .
An Anglo-Egyptian Sudan was established the following year with Equatoria being the southernmost of its eight provinces .
The isolated region was largely left to itself over the following decades , but Christian missionaries converted much of the population and facilitated the spread of English .
When Sudan gained its independence in 1956 , it was with the understanding that the southerners would be able to participate fully in the political system .
When the Arab Khartoum government reneged on its promises , a mutiny began that led to two prolonged periods of conflict ( 1955 - 1972 and 1983 - 2005 ) in which perhaps 2.5 million people died - mostly civilians - due to starvation and drought .
Ongoing peace talks finally resulted in a Comprehensive Peace Agreement , signed in January 2005 .
As part of this agreement the south was granted a six-year period of autonomy to be followed by a referendum on final status .
The result of this referendum , held in January 2011 , was a vote of 98 % in favor of secession .
Independence was attained on 9 July 2011 .

Poland is an ancient nation that was conceived near the middle of the 10th century .
Its golden age occurred in the 16th century .
During the following century , the strengthening of the gentry and internal disorders weakened the nation .
In a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795 , Russia , Prussia , and Austria partitioned Poland among themselves .
Poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by Germany and the Soviet Union in World War II .
It became a Soviet satellite state following the war , but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive .
Labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union " Solidarity " that over time became a political force and by 1990 had swept parliamentary elections and the presidency .
A " shock therapy " program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in Central Europe , but Poland still faces the lingering challenges of high unemployment , underdeveloped and dilapidated infrastructure , and a poor rural underclass .
Poland joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004 .
With its transformation to a democratic , market-oriented country largely completed , Poland is an increasingly active member of Euro-Atlantic organizations .

Denmark made a modest recovery in 2010 in part because of increased government spending .
An impending decline in the ratio of workers to retirees will be a major long-term issue .
Denmark maintained a healthy budget surplus for many years up to 2008 , but the budget balance swung into deficit during 2009 - 10 .
Nonetheless , Denmark 's fiscal position remains among the strongest in the EU .
Despite previously meeting the criteria to join the European Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) , so far Denmark has decided not to join , although the Danish krone remains pegged to the euro .

The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom says sectarian and religiously motivated violence persists in Pakistan and that the government 's response continues to be insufficient .
The Commission 's annual report says in Uzbekistan , restrictive laws on religion severely limit the ability of religious communities to function , and the government controls the manner in which the Islamic faith is practiced .
The report says President Saparmurat Niyazov 's monopoly of power and absolute control in Turkmenistan render any independent religious activity in the country impossible .
Afghanistan , where the former Taleban regime was once designated as a particularly severe violator , has been added to a watch list of countries that violate religious freedom .
Also on the list is Bangladesh where religious extremism threatens freedom of religion .
Though not on the watch list , the commission says it is closely monitoring the situation in India and Sri Lanka .

The attacks also come a day after Iraq 's Electoral Commission certified election results that solidify Shi'ite dominance in the new National Assembly .

The cocaine was hidden in 128 black suitcases and had a street value of $ 100 million .
The pilot escaped , but the co-pilot was arrested , along with two Mexicans who arrived in another aircraft .
Venezuela neighbors Colombia - the world 's largest cocaine producer - and is often used as a transit route for cocaine destined for other countries .
Britain 's Foreign Secretary says China 's stand on Taiwan has made it more difficult for the European Union to end its embargo on weapons sales to Beijing .
Jack Straw said in a British television interview Sunday that the political environment had worsened since China passed a law last week granting itself the right to attack Taiwan if it declared independence .
The European Union had been planning to lift the weapons ban this year .
But last Thursday , an EU official said the issue may now be delayed .
Mr. Straw noted that the EU 's main policy-making body was not planning to consider the issue when it meets next Tuesday .
The United States has strongly opposed lifting the ban , saying the move could threaten Taiwan 's security .
The embargo goes back to China 's 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters .

They spilled fake blood on the steps leading to the building , saying it symbolized those who died in the 1998 to 1999 war with Serbia .
The demonstration came one day after Kosovo 's Albanian-dominated parliament approved a plan to create a team to talk with Serbia on the province 's political status .
Kosovo is legally part of Serbia .
But it has been under United Nations administration since 1999 , when Serbian forces withdrew after a campaign of NATO air strikes aimed at ending Belgrade 's crackdown on ethnic Albanians .
The province 's Serbian minority and Serbia want it to remain part of Serbia .

Trinidad and Tobago has earned a reputation as an excellent investment site for international businesses and has one of the highest growth rates and per capita incomes in Latin America .
Economic growth between 2000 and 2007 averaged slightly over 8 % , significantly above the regional average of about 3.7 % for that same period ; however , GDP has slowed down since then and contracted about 3.5 % in 2009 , before rising more than 2 % in 2010 .
Growth has been fueled by investments in liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) , petrochemicals , and steel .
Additional petrochemical , aluminum , and plastics projects are in various stages of planning .
Trinidad and Tobago is the leading Caribbean producer of oil and gas , and its economy is heavily dependent upon these resources but it also supplies manufactured goods , notably food products and beverages , as well as cement to the Caribbean region .
Oil and gas account for about 40 % of GDP and 80 % of exports , but only 5 % of employment .
The country is also a regional financial center , and tourism is a growing sector , although it is not as important domestically as it is to many other Caribbean islands .
The economy benefits from a growing trade surplus .
The previous MANNING administration benefited from fiscal surpluses fueled by the dynamic export sector ; however , declines in oil and gas prices have reduced government revenues which will challenge the new government 's commitment to maintaining high levels of public investment .
Italy 's highest court has thrown out charges against U.S. and Italian intelligence agents accused of kidnapping an Egyptian Islamist cleric in Milan in 2003 .
The court Wednesday backed the Italian government 's argument that prosecutors illegally used classified intelligence information as evidence .
Prosecutors contended the state was using the secrecy argument to obstruct justice .
The case involves 26 Americans - most of them believed to be Central Intelligence Agency operatives - and Italian defendants .
They include the former head of Italy 's military intelligence agency , Nicolo Pollari .
The defendants are accused of kidnapping Egyptian imam Abu Omar from Milan and flying him to Egypt where he says he was tortured in prison .
The Americans were being tried in absentia .
The Italian government has not asked for their extradition , and the CIA has refused comment on the case .
Witnesses in Somalia 's capital say the militant group al-Shabab has publicly executed two teenagers by firing squad .
The executions took place Monday in front of hundreds of Mogadishu residents .
One of the teens executed was a 15-year-old boy , accused of sexually molesting another boy , age 9 .
The other teen , said to be 18 years old , was accused of spying for the Somali transitional government .
Al-Shabab is trying to overthrow the Western-backed government and impose a harshly conservative form of Islamic law across Somalia .
Last month , the group executed two teenage girls it accused of spying for the government .
Back in April , it publicly executed an accused murderer and chopped off the hand of an alleged thief .
Algeria 's economy remains dominated by the state , a legacy of the country 's socialist post-independence development model .
Gradual liberalization since the mid-1990s has opened up more of the economy , but in recent years Algeria has imposed new restrictions on foreign involvement in its economy and largely halted the privatization of state-owned industries .
Hydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy , accounting for roughly 60 % of budget revenues , 30 % of GDP , and over 95 % of export earnings .
Algeria has the eighth-largest reserves of natural gas in the world and is the fourth-largest gas exporter .
It ranks 16th in oil reserves .
Thanks to strong hydrocarbon revenues , Algeria has a cushion of $ 150 billion in foreign currency reserves and a large hydrocarbon stabilization fund .
In addition , Algeria 's external debt is extremely low at about 1 % of GDP .
Algeria has struggled to develop industries outside of hydrocarbons in part because of high costs and an inert state bureaucracy .
The government 's efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector have done little to reduce high poverty and youth unemployment rates .
In 2010 , Algeria began a five-year , $ 286 billion development program to update the country 's infrastructure and provide jobs .
The costly program will boost Algeria 's economy in 2011 but worsen the country 's budget deficit .
Long-term economic challenges include diversification from hydrocarbons , relaxing state control of the economy , and providing adequate jobs for younger Algerians .

Pakistan 's majority Sunni and minority Shi'ite communities largely co-exist in peace .
But militants from the two sides have a history of violence that has claimed thousands of lives in the past decade .

Sarkozy 's office Wednesday categorically dismissed the report in Le Canard Enchaine weekly as untrue .
The president 's office also denied the report .
The newspaper said Mr. Chirac endorsed Sarkozy 's candidacy in the April 22 election in exchange for a promise that if he wins , the conservative candidate will sponsor a bill that would spare the outgoing president from prosecution .
The article says a new anti-crime bill would set a 10-year limit on the time a judge has to close a case .
This would end a corruption probe involving Mr. Chirac 's activities while serving as Paris mayor before he assumed the French presidency in 1995 .

British authorities say the man fatally shot by police in a subway station on Friday was not connected to the recent attacks on London 's transit system .
In a statement released Saturday , Scotland Yard called the shooting a " tragedy , " and one deeply regretted by London 's Metropolitan Police .
Officials say the man was under surveillance in connection with Thursday 's attempted bombings , and refused police orders to stop while running through a subway station .
Witnesses said plainclothes officers chased the Asian-looking man onto a subway car , and then shot him at point-blank range .
Muslim leaders condemned the killing and called for a full investigation .
Meanwhile , experts say forensic evidence and the timing of Thursday 's attacks exactly two weeks after the July 7 bombings that killed 56 people suggest both attacks may have been planned by the same terrorist group .

Niger is a landlocked , Sub-Saharan nation , whose economy centers on subsistence crops , livestock , and some of the world 's largest uranium deposits .
Niger also has sizable reserves of oil , and oil production , refining , and exports are expected to grow significantly between 2011 and 2016 .
Drought , desertification , and strong population growth have undercut the economy .
Niger shares a common currency , the CFA franc , and a common central bank , the Central Bank of West African States ( BCEAO ) , with seven other members of the West African Monetary Union .
In December 2000 , Niger qualified for enhanced debt relief under the International Monetary Fund program for Highly Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) and concluded an agreement with the Fund on a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility ( PRGF ) .
Debt relief provided under the enhanced HIPC initiative significantly reduces Niger 's annual debt service obligations , freeing funds for expenditures on basic health care , primary education , HIV / AIDS prevention , rural infrastructure , and other programs geared at poverty reduction .
In December 2005 , Niger received 100 % multilateral debt relief from the IMF , which translates into the forgiveness of approximately US $ 86 million in debts to the IMF , excluding the remaining assistance under HIPC .
In 2010 , the Niger economy was recovering from the effects of a 2009 drought that reduced grain and cowpea production and decimated livestock herds .
The economy was also hurt when the international community cut off non-humanitarian aid in response to TANDJA 's moves to extend his term as president .
Nearly half of the government 's budget is derived from foreign donor resources .
Future growth may be sustained by exploitation of oil , gold , coal , and other mineral resources .

The Russian prosecutor-general 's office declined comment on the Savelyev report , published Tuesday by the Russian news media .
The 700-page report also claims that Russian commanders waited more than two hours to give orders to put out a gymnasium fire , in which many hostages were burned alive .
