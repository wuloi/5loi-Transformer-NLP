Clustering of missense mutations in the ataxia-telangiectasia gene in a sporadic T-cell leukaemia. Ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T ) is a recessive multi-system disorder caused by mutations in the ATM gene at 11q22-q23 ( ref . 3 ) . The risk of cancer , especially lymphoid neoplasias , is substantially elevated in A-T patients and has long been associated with chromosomal instability . By analysing tumour DNA from patients with sporadic T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia ( T-PLL ) , a rare clonal malignancy with similarities to a mature T-cell leukaemia seen in A-T , we demonstrate a high frequency of ATM mutations in T-PLL . In marked contrast to the ATM mutation pattern in A-T , the most frequent nucleotide changes in this leukaemia were missense mutations . These clustered in the region corresponding to the kinase domain , which is highly conserved in ATM-related proteins in mouse , yeast and Drosophila . The resulting amino-acid substitutions are predicted to interfere with ATP binding or substrate recognition . Two of seventeen mutated T-PLL samples had a previously reported A-T allele . In contrast , no mutations were detected in the p53 gene , suggesting that this tumour suppressor is not frequently altered in this leukaemia . Occasional missense mutations in ATM were also found in tumour DNA from patients with B-cell non-Hodgkins lymphomas ( B-NHL ) and a B-NHL cell line . The evidence of a significant proportion of loss-of-function mutations and a complete absence of the normal copy of ATM in the majority of mutated tumours establishes somatic inactivation of this gene in the pathogenesis of sporadic T-PLL and suggests that ATM acts as a tumour suppressor . As constitutional DNA was not available , a putative hereditary predisposition to T-PLL will require further investigation . . 	0
Myotonic dystrophy protein kinase is involved in the modulation of the Ca2+ homeostasis in skeletal muscle cells. Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) , the most prevalent muscular disorder in adults , is caused by ( CTG ) n-repeat expansion in a gene encoding a protein kinase ( DM protein kinase ; DMPK ) and involves changes in cytoarchitecture and ion homeostasis . To obtain clues to the normal biological role of DMPK in cellular ion homeostasis , we have compared the resting [ Ca2 + ] i , the amplitude and shape of depolarization-induced Ca2 + transients , and the content of ATP-driven ion pumps in cultured skeletal muscle cells of wild-type and DMPK [ - / - ] knockout mice . In vitro-differentiated DMPK [ - / - ] myotubes exhibit a higher resting [ Ca2 + ] i than do wild-type myotubes because of an altered open probability of voltage-dependent l-type Ca2 + and Na + channels . The mutant myotubes exhibit smaller and slower Ca2 + responses upon triggering by acetylcholine or high external K + . In addition , we observed that these Ca2 + transients partially result from an influx of extracellular Ca2 + through the l-type Ca2 + channel . Neither the content nor the activity of Na + / K + ATPase and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2 + -ATPase are affected by DMPK absence . In conclusion , our data suggest that DMPK is involved in modulating the initial events of excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle . . 	1
Constitutional RB1-gene mutations in patients with isolated unilateral retinoblastoma. In most patients with isolated unilateral retinoblastoma , tumor development is initiated by somatic inactivation of both alleles of the RB1 gene . However , some of these patients can transmit retinoblastoma predisposition to their offspring . To determine the frequency and nature of constitutional RB1-gene mutations in patients with isolated unilateral retinoblastoma , we analyzed DNA from peripheral blood and from tumor tissue . The analysis of tumors from 54 ( 71 % ) of 76 informative patients showed loss of constitutional heterozygosity ( LOH ) at intragenic loci . Three of 13 uninformative patients had constitutional deletions . For 39 randomly selected tumors , SSCP , hetero-duplex analysis , sequencing , and Southern blot analysis were used to identify mutations . Mutations were detected in 21 ( 91 % ) of 23 tumors with LOH . In 6 ( 38 % ) of 16 tumors without LOH , one mutation was detected , and in 9 ( 56 % ) of the tumors without LOH , both mutations were found . Thus , a total of 45 mutations were identified in tumors of 36 patients . Thirty-nine of the mutations-including 34 small mutations , 2 large structural alterations , and hypermethylation in 3 tumors-were not detected in the corresponding peripheral blood DNA . In 6 ( 17 % ) of the 36 patients , a mutation was detected in constitutional DNA , and 1 of these mutations is known to be associated with reduced expressivity . The presence of a constitutional mutation was not associated with an early age at treatment . In 1 patient , somatic mosaicism was demonstrated by molecular analysis of DNA and RNA from peripheral blood . In 2 patients without a detectable mutation in peripheral blood , mosaicism was suggested because 1 of the patients showed multifocal tumors and the other later developed bilateral retinoblastoma . In conclusion , our results emphasize that the manifestation and transmissibility of retinoblastoma depend on the nature of the first mutation , its time in development , and the number and types of cells that are affected . . 	2
Hereditary deficiency of the fifth component of complement in man. I. Clinical, immunochemical, and family studies. The first recognized human kindred with hereditary deficiency of the fifth component of complement ( C5 ) is described . The proband , a 20-year-old black female with systemic lupus erythematosus since age 11 , lacked serum hemolytic complement activity , even during remission . C5 was undetectable in her serum by both immunodiffusion and hemolytic assays . Other complement components were normal during remission of lupus , but C1 , C4 , C2 , and C3 levels fell during exacerbations . A younger half-sister , who had no underlying disease , was also found to lack immunochemically detectable C5 . By hemolytic assay , she exhibited 1-2 % of the normal serum C5 level and normal concentrations of other complement components . C5 levels of other family members were either normal or approximately half-normal , consistent with autosomal codominant inheritance of the gene determining C5 deficiency . Normal hemolytic titers were restored to both homozygous C5-deficient ( C5D ) sera by addition of highly purified human C5 . In specific C5 titrations , however , it was noted that when limited amounts of C5 were assayed in the presence of low dilutions of either C5D serum , curving rather than linear dose-response plots were consistently obtained , suggesting some inhibitory effect . Further studies suggested that low dilutions of C5D serum contain a factor ( or factors ) interfering at some step in the hemolytic assay of C5 , rather than a true C5 inhibitor or inactivator . Of clinical interest are ( a ) the documentation of membranous glomerulonephritis , vasculitis , and arthritis in an individual lacking C5 ( and its biologic functions ) , and ( b ) a remarkable propensity to bacterial infections in the proband , even during periods of low-dose or alternate-day corticosteroid therapy . Other observations indicate that the C5D state is compatible with normal coagulation function and the capacity to mount a neutrophilic leukocytosis during pyogenic infection . . 	2
Susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis in twins: the role of genes, HLA, and the environment. OBJECTIVE  To determine the relative effects of genetic and environmental factors in susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) . METHODS  Twins with AS were identified from the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases database . Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed to establish diagnoses , and disease severity was assessed using a combination of validated scoring systems . HLA typing for HLA-B27 , HLA-B60 , and HLA-DR1 was performed by polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers , and zygosity was assessed using microsatellite markers . Genetic and environmental variance components were assessed with the program Mx , using data from this and previous studies of twins with AS . RESULTS  Six of 8 monozygotic ( MZ ) twin pairs were disease concordant , compared with 4 of 15 B27-positive dizygotic ( DZ ) twin pairs ( 27 % ) and 4 of 32 DZ twin pairs overall ( 12 . 5 % ) . Nonsignificant increases in similarity with regard to age at disease onset and all of the disease severity scores assessed were noted in disease-concordant MZ twins compared with concordant DZ twins . HLA-B27 and B60 were associated with the disease in probands , and the rate of disease concordance was significantly increased among DZ twin pairs in which the co-twin was positive for both B27 and DR1 . Additive genetic effects were estimated to contribute 97 % of the population variance . CONCLUSION  Susceptibility to AS is largely genetically determined , and the environmental trigger for the disease is probably ubiquitous . HLA-B27 accounts for a minority of the overall genetic susceptibility to AS . 	2
Cell cycle-dependent colocalization of BARD1 and BRCA1 proteins in discrete nuclear domains. Germ-line mutations of the BRCA1 gene predispose women to early-onset breast and ovarian cancer by compromising the genes presumptive function as a tumor suppressor . Although the biochemical properties of BRCA1 polypeptides are not understood , their expression pattern and subcellular localization suggest a role in cell-cycle regulation . When resting cells are induced to proliferate , the steady-state levels of BRCA1 increase in late G1 and reach a maximum during S phase . Moreover , in S phase cells , BRCA1 polypeptides are hyperphosphorylated and accumulate into discrete subnuclear foci termed " BRCA1 nuclear dots . " BRCA1 associates in vivo with a structurally related protein termed BARD1 . Here we show that the steady-state levels of BARD1 , unlike those of BRCA1 , remain relatively constant during cell cycle progression . However , immunostaining revealed that BARD1 resides within BRCA1 nuclear dots during S phase of the cell cycle , but not during the G1 phase . Nevertheless , BARD1 polypeptides are found exclusively in the nuclear fractions of both G1- and S-phase cells . Therefore , progression to S phase is accompanied by the aggregation of nuclear BARD1 polypeptides into BRCA1 nuclear dots . This cell cycle-dependent colocalization of BARD1 and BRCA1 indicates a role for BARD1 in BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression . 	0
Ethnic differences in the HFE codon 282 (Cys/Tyr) polymorphism. Recent studies have shown that hereditary hemochromatosis ( HH ) is likely to be caused by homozygosity for a Cys282Tyr mutation in the HFE gene located 4 . 5 Mb telomeric to HLA-A . Population studies of this polymorphism are facilitated by the fact that the Cys282Tyr mutation creates a Rsal restriction site . We have studied the codon 282 ( Cys / Tyr ) polymorphism in different ethnic groups . In agreement with previous observations the Tyr allele appeared to be rare or absent in Asiatic ( Indian , Chinese ) populations . The highest allele frequency ( 7 . 5 % ) was found in Swedes . Saamis ( 2 % ) and Mordvinians ( 1 . 8 % ) had significantly lower frequencies of the Tyr allele . Comparisons with allele frequencies based on prevalence estimates of HH showed some disagreements with the RFLP data , particularly in Finns . The newly described HFE marker provides a new approach to the screening of HH as well as studies of the relationship between the HFE Tyr allele and different disorders including cancer 	0
Autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus associated with a missense mutation encoding Gly23-->Val in neurophysin II. Autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus ( ADNDI ) is an inherited disease caused by progressive degeneration of the magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamus leading to decreased ability to produce the hormone arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) . Affected individuals are not symptomatic at birth , but usually develop diabetes insipidus at 1-6 yr of age . The genetic locus of the disease is the AVP-neurophysin II ( NPII ) gene , and mutations that cause ADNDI have been found in both the signal peptide of the prepro-AVP-NPII precursor and within NPII itself . An affected girl who presented at 9 months of age and her similarly affected younger brother and father were all found to have a novel missense mutation ( G1758-- > T ) encoding the amino acid substitution Gly23-- > Val within NPII . The mutation was confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis . A T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the fathers pituitary gland demonstrates an attenuated posterior pituitary bright spot . This mutation may be valuable for developing models of dominantly inherited neurodegeneration , as the early age of onset of symptoms suggests that this mutation may be particularly deleterious to the magnocellular neuron . . 	2
Frequent inactivation of PTEN/MMAC1 in primary prostate cancer. Sporadic prostate carcinoma is the most common male cancer in the Western world , yet many of the major genetic events involved in the progression of this often fatal cancer remain to be elucidated . Numerous cytogenetic and allelotype studies have reported frequent loss of heterozygosity on chromosomal arm 10q in sporadic prostate cancer . Deletion mapping studies have unambiguously identified a region of chromosome 10q23 to be the minimal area of loss . A new tumor suppressor gene , PTEN / MMAC1 , was isolated recently at this region of chromosome 10q23 and found to be inactivated by mutation in three prostate cancer cell lines . We screened 80 prostate tumors by microsatellite analysis and found chromosome 10q23 to be deleted in 23 cases . We then proceeded with sequence analysis of the entire PTEN / MMAC1 coding region and tested for homozygous deletion with new intragenic markers in these 23 cases with 10q23 loss of heterozygosity . The identification of the second mutational event in 10 ( 43 % ) tumors establishes PTEN / MMAC1 as a main inactivation target of 10q loss in sporadic prostate cancer . . 	0
Risk reversals in predictive testing for Huntington disease. The first predictive testing for Huntington disease ( HD ) was based on analysis of linked polymorphic DNA markers to estimate the likelihood of inheriting the mutation for HD . Limits to accuracy included recombination between the DNA markers and the mutation , pedigree structure , and whether DNA samples were available from family members . With direct tests for the HD mutation , we have assessed the accuracy of results obtained by linkage approaches when requested to do so by the test individuals . For six such individuals , there was significant disparity between the tests . Three went from a decreased risk to an increased risk , while in another three the risk was decreased . Knowledge of the potential reasons for these changes in results and impact of these risk reversals on both patients and the counseling team can assist in the development of strategies for the prevention and , where necessary , management of a risk reversal in any predictive testing program . . 	1
